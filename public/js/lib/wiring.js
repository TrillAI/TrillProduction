  const ORDER = [
    { pos: 1, name: 'Guitar → Tuner', why: 'A tuner first means you can mute and tune without hunting for a pedal. Buffered tuners also give the chain a clean signal. Power it from its own isolated output.', pedal: 'Boss TU-3, TC Polytune 3' },
    { pos: 2, name: 'Wah / Envelope filter / Fuzz (germanium)', why: 'Wah and vintage fuzz want the raw, unbuffered guitar signal. Put fuzz FIRST if it’s germanium (Fuzz Face, Tone Bender) — a buffer in front ruins its cleanup. Many players put the wah before the fuzz; try both, the fuzz usually wins first place.', pedal: 'Fuzz Face, Cry Baby, Mu-Tron III' },
    { pos: 3, name: 'Compressor', why: 'Before the dirt so it can feed a consistent signal into the drive stages, and so the drives don’t fight the compressor’s dynamics. If you want the drive to ride your playing dynamics, put the comp AFTER the drive instead.', pedal: 'Dyna Comp, Keeley Comp Plus' },
    { pos: 4, name: 'Overdrive / Boost', why: 'Boost into drive, drive into distortion: gain stacking works because each stage compounds the next. Put the pedal you want to sound “loudest” last in the dirt section.', pedal: 'TS-808, Klon, SD-1' },
    { pos: 5, name: 'Distortion / Fuzz (silicon, Muff)', why: 'Higher-gain, more compressed pedals go later in the dirt stack. A Muff after a RAT sounds like a wall; a RAT after a Muff sounds like a splat.', pedal: 'RAT, Big Muff, DS-1' },
    { pos: 6, name: 'EQ / Volume pedal', why: 'EQ here shapes everything that came before it. A volume pedal before modulation keeps the delay/reverb tails ringing out at the end of a swell — put it before the time-based pedals, not at the very end.', pedal: 'Boss GE-7, Ernie Ball VP Jr' },
    { pos: 7, name: 'Modulation (chorus · flanger · phaser · tremolo · vibe)', why: 'Modulation goes after dirt so it modulates the distorted signal evenly. Before dirt it gets mushy and loses definition. Uni-Vibe is the exception: many players put it in front of the drive.', pedal: 'CE-2, Phase 90, BF-2' },
    { pos: 8, name: 'Delay', why: 'After modulation so the repeats are clean and consistent. Time-based effects last = a “mix” of the whole board.', pedal: 'DD-3, Memory Man, El Capistan' },
    { pos: 9, name: 'Reverb', why: 'Reverb last: it’s the room at the end of the room. Delay into reverb = classic; reverb into delay = surreal (a valid choice, just know what you’re doing).', pedal: 'Flint, BigSky, Holy Grail' },
    { pos: 10, name: 'Looper', why: 'A looper at the very end captures everything you heard, including your reverb. If you want to loop a dry signal, put it before the time-based pedals instead.', pedal: 'RC-5, Ditto X2' },
    { pos: 11, name: '→ Amp input, or → FX loop', why: 'Time-based and modulation pedals sound clearer in a series FX loop (after the preamp). Anything that shapes distortion belongs in FRONT of the amp input.', pedal: 'See the FX loop section' }
  ];

  /* ---------------- effects loop / 4-cable method ---------------- */
  const FX_LOOP = [
    '**The loop sits after the amp’s preamp and before the power amp.** That means delay, reverb and modulation in the loop stay clean and hi-fi — the preamp distortion doesn’t smear them.',
    '**Put in FRONT of the amp:** tuner, wah, fuzz, comp, overdrive, distortion, EQ, boost. These shape what the preamp sees.',
    '**Put in the LOOP:** chorus, flanger, phaser, tremolo, delay, reverb, looper. These reproduce what the preamp made.',
    '**Series loop (most amps):** amp send → pedal → amp return. Simple, always works, and the pedals’ dry signal is your amp’s sound.',
    '**Parallel loop (some Mesas/old Marshalls):** the amp mixes the loop signal with the dry signal. Pedals with a wet/dry mix (like a Timeline) work best; digital pedals with a delay in their own conversion can cause phase trouble.',
    '**The 4-cable method** (gate + some pedals in the loop, some in front): guitar → front pedals → amp input · amp send → loop pedals → amp return. That’s four cables: two for the front run and two for the loop.',
    '**Gain staging in the loop:** start with the pedal’s output at unity and use the amp’s loop level if it has one. A hot pedal in the loop = clipped preamp = bad. A weak one = hiss.',
    '**No loop?** Put the time-based pedals in front and accept a slightly smeared repeat — that’s exactly how Hendrix, Gilmour (early) and The Edge got their sounds. It’s not a compromise, it’s a tone.',
    '**The 4-cable gate (Decimator G-String / NS-2 with loop):** guitar → gate → front pedals → amp input; amp send → gate return → gate output → amp return. Now the gate silences both your pedals AND the amp’s own hiss.'
  ];

  /* ---------------- power ---------------- */
  const POWER = [
    '**Most pedals are 9V DC, centre-negative** (Boss-style barrel). Check every pedal — a few (older Colorsound, some germanium fuzzes, Positive Grid) are centre-POSITIVE and will be damaged by a standard supply.',
    '**Daisy-chaining works for analog pedals** with small current draw (usually under 100 mA). It fails for anything digital or noisy.',
    '**Never daisy-chain:** digital delays, reverbs, tuners, modelers or anything with a clock. They inject ticking and whine into every pedal sharing the chain.',
    '**Add up the milliamps.** Every pedal lists its draw (typically 5–50 mA analog, 100–500 mA digital). Buy a supply at least 30% above your total, and never exceed an individual output’s rating.',
    '**Isolated outputs are the fix for hum.** An isolated supply (Truetone CS12, Voodoo Lab Pedal Power 3, Cioks DC7) gives every pedal its own ground reference — no ground loops.',
    '**Voltage matters:** 12V and 18V outputs give more headroom to pedals that accept them (many overdrives and delays love 18V — MXR Carbon Copy and most analog delays do NOT; check first).',
    '**Battery vs supply:** germanium fuzzes often sound better on a battery (Fuzz Face, Tone Bender). They also hate sharing a supply with a buffered/digital pedal.',
    '**Amp power:** 100W tube heads draw 300–500W from the wall. Use a proper IEC cable, a grounded outlet, and never lift the ground pin to kill hum — fix the hum.',
    '**Wall warts vs supplies:** a single cheap wall-wart feeding six pedals through a daisy chain is the #1 cause of “my board hums”. Spend the money on isolation.',
    '**Cable length = tone loss.** Instrument cable has capacitance (~30 pF/ft). 30 ft of cable into a passive guitar rolls off high end noticeably. Keep boards short, use buffered pedals or a dedicated buffer at the start and end.'
  ];

  /* ---------------- cables & levels ---------------- */
  const CABLES = [
    { name: 'Instrument cable (TS, unbalanced)', use: 'Guitar → pedals → amp input.', tip: '1/4" TS jack. Keep runs under 20 ft when possible; use 20–25 ft for stage freedom and accept the tiny high-end loss, or add a buffer.' },
    { name: 'Speaker cable', use: 'Amp output → speaker cabinet.', tip: 'NEVER use an instrument cable here. It is thinner, and the current will melt it — or worse, short the amp and kill the output transformer. Speaker cable is unshielded and heavier gauge.' },
    { name: 'Balanced TRS / XLR cable', use: 'Line out, DI, loop-level signals, mic cables.', tip: 'Balanced sends cancel noise over long runs. Use XLR to the desk, TRS for line-level loops.' },
    { name: 'Patch cable (pedalboard)', use: 'Pedal → pedal.', tip: 'Flat pancake jacks save space. Measure before you buy: 6 in, 12 in, and a couple of 18 in covers most boards.' },
    { name: 'Patch cable with TRS (expression)', use: 'Expression pedal → pedal.', tip: 'Most expression inputs need a TRS cable (tip = wiper, ring = 3.3V). A TS cable will make the pedal behave like an on/off switch instead of a sweep.' },
    { name: 'USB / interface cable', use: 'Recording into a computer.', tip: 'A class-compliant interface + the Katana/Tone Master USB out is the cheapest good recording setup there is.' },
    { name: 'Y / insert cable', use: 'Parallel amps, insert points, TRS effects loops.', tip: 'A “Y” insert cable (TRS → 2 × TS) is the standard for a single-jack insert loop.' }

  /* ---------------- impedance & speaker loads ---------------- */
  const IMPEDANCE = [
    '**Match the impedance.** A tube amp wants its rated load (usually 8Ω or 16Ω, some have a switch). Mismatching DOWN (amp expects 8Ω, cab is 4Ω) stresses the output transformer; mismatching UP (amp expects 8Ω, cab is 16Ω) is quieter and usually survivable but not ideal.',
    '**Never run a tube amp with no speaker connected.** No load = the output transformer’s voltage spikes into the thousands of volts and destroys the amp. Some amps have a “headphone out” or a built-in load — those are safe.',
    '**Solid-state amps** are generally more tolerant of mismatches but will still overheat — check the manual.',
    '**Two cabs, half each:** two 8Ω cabs in parallel = 4Ω total. Two 16Ω cabs in parallel = 8Ω. Set the amp’s impedance switch to the total, not to one cab.',
    '**Combos** usually have a fixed internal speaker — the external jack gives you a total-load change. Read the label before you plug in another cab.',
    '**Wattage headroom:** a cab should handle at least 1.5× the amp’s rated power. A 100W amp needs 150W+ of speakers; a 4×12 of 25W Greenbacks (=100W) is NOT enough for a 100W Plexi.',
    '**Attenuators and load boxes** (Fryette Power Station, Two notes Captor, Weber Mass) sit between the amp and the speaker and let you crank the amp quietly. They’re the honest way to get power-amp distortion at home volume.',
    '**Impedance mismatch and pedals:** pedals care about *input* impedance (1 MΩ is the standard for guitar). Some vintage fuzzes have a low input impedance — that’s exactly why they must be first in the chain.'

  /* ---------------- troubleshooting ---------------- */
  const TROUBLE = [
    { symptom: 'Loud hum that stops when you touch the strings', cause: 'Ground loop or a bad cable shield.', fix: 'Try another cable first, then a different outlet for the amp. Isolated power supply outputs fix most pedalboard ground loops. Never remove the ground pin from the amp’s plug.' },
    { symptom: 'High-pitched whine that changes with a delay pedal’s settings', cause: 'A digital pedal sharing a daisy chain.', fix: 'Give the digital pedal its own isolated output. This one fix solves 80% of pedalboard noise.' },
    { symptom: 'Radio station / taxi radio through the amp', cause: 'Poor shielding, long unbalanced runs, or a bad cable.', fix: 'Shorten the cable run, check for a broken shield (wiggle test), and add a buffer. Move the board away from power supplies.' },
    { symptom: 'Tuner / wah makes everything thin when off', cause: 'The pedal is a tone-sucking vintage bypass or an unbuffered hardwire bypass with a long cable run behind it.', fix: 'Add a buffer first in the chain, or put the pedal in a bypass loop (Boss LS-2 / a true-bypass looper).' },
    { symptom: 'Fuzz sounds thin and sputtery', cause: 'A buffer (or a non-true-bypass pedal) in front of a germanium fuzz.', fix: 'Move the fuzz to position 1, directly after the guitar. Nothing between the guitar and a Fuzz Face, ever.' },
    { symptom: 'Notes cut off awkwardly at high gain', cause: 'A noise gate set too aggressively, or the input signal too low.', fix: 'Lower the gate threshold and set the release slower. Also check your pickup height — a weak input makes gates misbehave.' },
    { symptom: 'Amp squeals whenever you turn up', cause: 'Microphonic tube, or a high-gain oscillation.', fix: 'Tap each preamp tube with a pencil (amp off, then on and listening): a ringing tube is microphonic. Replace it. Otherwise, check pedal order and gain staging.' },
    { symptom: 'Amp crackles and fades in and out', cause: 'A tired power tube or a dirty tube socket.', fix: 'Reseat the tubes (amp off, cooled down, pins aligned). If it continues, replace the power tubes in matched pairs.' },
    { symptom: 'Everything sounds fine alone but disappears in the band', cause: 'Too much bass / too little midrange, or a scooped EQ.', fix: 'Turn the bass DOWN and the mids UP. Live guitar lives between 300 Hz and 3 kHz — a mid-forward tone always cuts better.' },
    { symptom: 'Pedal LED dims when you engage it', cause: 'Not enough current from the supply.', fix: 'Add the pedals’ mA ratings and buy adequate power. Undervolted digital pedals do all kinds of strange things.' },
    { symptom: 'Buzzing/rattle from the amp or cab', cause: 'A loose screw, tube retainer, or a speaker baffle screw.', fix: 'Tighten every screw you can find. Rattle is almost always mechanical, not electronic.' },
    { symptom: 'Scratchy knob noise', cause: 'A dirty potentiometer.', fix: 'DeoxIT D5 into the pot (very small amount), work it back and forth 20 times. Do not soak the circuit board.' }

  /* ---------------- recording ---------------- */
  const RECORDING = [
    '**Mic the amp** for the real thing: SM57 1 inch off the grille at the cap edge → interface → DAW. Record at a moderate level (peaks around −12 dBFS) so you can re-amp or re-process later.',
    '**Blend a close mic with a room mic** for depth: close for punch, 3–6 ft back for space. Check phase by flipping one channel’s polarity and keeping whichever version sounds fuller.',
    '**DI + reamp** is the flexible route: record the dry DI, then send it back out to a real amp later and mic it. You can also send a DI through the virtual rig here.',
    '**Load box / cab sim** (Two notes Captor, UA OX, Power Station) lets you record a cranked tube amp at 3 a.m. with headphones.',
    '**USB amp outs** (Katana, Tone Master, most modern practice amps) are the cheapest path to good recorded tone. No mic, no room, no neighbours.',
    '**High-pass at 80–100 Hz** on rhythm guitars and let the bass own the low end. Cutting low end on guitar is the fastest way to make a mix sound professional.',
    '**Double-track rhythms**, pan one hard left and one hard right, and play the part twice rather than copying a track — the tiny timing differences are what make it huge.',
    '**Don’t record at maximum gain.** High gain loses definition in a mix. Use enough gain to feel right and let the bass guitar and cymbals carry the impression of “heavy”.',
    '**Headroom for pedals:** keep pedal levels near unity unless you deliberately want to push the amp. Recording with everything dimed means nothing is left for the mix.',
    '**Headphones rule:** if you monitor the amp through speakers while recording a mic, you will create feedback and bleed. Use closed-back headphones.'
